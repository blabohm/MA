\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces The network colors depict the cumulative LS. A higher LS value is depicted by a darker red color, representing i.) more people taking this path, ii.) the people taking this path are living in closer proximity to the green space, and / or iii.) the path is leading to a larger green space. Since the LS values are cumulative, a higher value might also mean more paths from different buildings overlapping (See appendix 3 for further information). The building colors represent average DI calculated for all green spaces in a network distance of 500 meters from a building. The darker blue the color of a building is, the closer to 1 the DI value, the more direct can its residents travel to the closest green spaces. The opposite is the case if the color tends towards orange. A = Josephinenstraße; B = Riebeckstraße; C = Leve-Voigt-Park}}{11}{figure.3}%

Higher DI means that the trajectories from a building to the nearest UGS entry have become more efficient. The top two maps show the unlimited access alternative.}}{17}{figure.7}%
